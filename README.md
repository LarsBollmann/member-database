# member-database
Our member database application

## Design Choices
- keep it simple
- keep it maintainable
- proven technologies > fancy stuff
- use things that we know

therefore we want to use
- pipenv (dependency management)
- sqlite or mysql (database)
- flask (API)
- itsdangerous (token-based authentication)
- sqlalchemy (ORM)
- if we don't know what to do: follow [the flask mega tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
- vue.js for the interface(s)
  - if possible CDNs, avoiding webpack et. al

## Development

We strongly recommend to read through the first chapters of the [the flask mega tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

1. Install python (>=3.6) and make sure you have pip

1. install pipenv using `pip install pipenv`, if you use your system's python, use
`pip install --user pipenv`

1. Install the dependencies using `pipenv install`

1. copy `env-template` to `.env` and fill the variables with the appropriate information
  
  The `DATABASE_URL` is set to an sqlite database in the current directory, which is nice for developing

1. run `export FLASK_APP=database`

1. To initialise the database, run
  ```
  $ pipenv run flask db init
  $ pipenv run flask db migrate
  $ pipenv run flask db upgrade
  ```

1. Start the server using `FLASK_DEBUG=true pipenv run flask run`

### Adding Users

To authenticate to certain endpoints you need to add a user. The simplest way
for now is to do this interactively in an iPython shell.

1. Make sure you installed the development dependencies `pipenv install --dev`

1. Fire up iPython via `pipenv run iphython`

1. Setup the global namespace with everything you need
   ```python
   In [1]: from database import app, db
   In [2]: from database.models import Person, User
   ```

1. Every User needs to be linked to a Person, so first you need to create a
   person, and store it in the database
   ```python
   In [3]: p = Person()
   In [4]: p.name = 'Albert Einstein'
   In [5]: p.email = 'albert@aol.de'
   ```

1. Now you can create a User and set its password
   ```python
   In [6]: u = User()
   In [7]: u.person = p
   In [8]: u.username = 'aeinstein'
   In [9]: u.set_password('supersecurepassword')

   # you can even chack the super secure hash of this password
   In [10]: u.password_hash
   ```

1. Finally store everything in the database
   ```python
   # this is needed to connect to the correct database
   In [12]: app.app_context().push()

   In [13]: db.session.add(p, u)
   In [14]: db.session.commit()
   ```

1. You can now login at the `/login` endpoint ðŸŽ‰
